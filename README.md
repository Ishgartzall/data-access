# Golang Jazz finder : accessing a relational database

This tutorial introduces the basics of accessing a relational database with Go and the database/sql package in its standard library. The database/sql package I'll be using includes types and functions for connecting to databases, executing transactions, canceling an operation in progress,...

In this tutorial I learnt to : 
- Create a folder for my code.
- Set up a database.
- Import the database driver.
- Get a database handle and connect.
- Query for multiple rows.
- Query for a single row.
- Add data.
